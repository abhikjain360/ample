# Ample

A keyboard-centric music player. It is **A**bhik's **M**usic **PL**ay**E**r.

## Why?

I couldn't find a music player for local files that I liked. This one lacks a lot (most? all?) of features, but it is everything I need. PRs welcome as long as the features I need are still working, and I'll not maintain the features I don't want so you or someone else needs to be responsible for those.
